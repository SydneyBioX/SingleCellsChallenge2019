# Introduction to challenge


# Aim 
To facillitate collaboration among single cell researchers around Australia and to promote innovative analysis approaches to multimodal datasets generated by latest single cell technologies. 

# Advanced computational workshop format
The workshop consists of an interactive group-work Hackathon session and a pitching session for results of the computational challenge. Before the meeting, participating teams of the computational challenge will download the CITE-seq data as described below and complete the analysis on their own time. The workshop will start with a Hackathon session. Participants will from different organisations will form Hackathon teams will discuss and come up with innovative analysis ideas for a spatial transcriptomics dataset. At the second part, flash presentations on computational challenge results (5 minutes) and Hackathon ideas (3 minutes) will be assessed by an expert panels and there will be prizes for the winning teams. 

# Datasets

## Dataset 1 - computational challenge

#### Description:

Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) + Cell Hashing data are kindly provided by Swarbrick’s Lab. The datasets have recently been generated from thymus samples with 2 biological replicates and three experimental conditions.

## Dataset 2: - the Hackathon

#### Description:

Spatial transcriptomics data of prostate cancer tissues were generated by Lunderberg’s Lab. The study has been published in Nature Communications (Berglund et al, 2018). Prior to the workshop, participants are encouraged to read the paper and to attend the two talks on spatial transcriptomics in the morning technology session.
