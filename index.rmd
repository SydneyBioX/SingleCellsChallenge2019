# Aim 

To facillitate collaboration among single cell researchers around Australia and to promote innovative analysis approaches to multimodal datasets generated by latest single cell technologies. 

# Advanced computational workshop format

The workshop consists of an interactive group-work Hackathon session and a pitching session for results of the computational challenge. Before the meeting, participating teams of the computational challenge will download the CITE-seq data as described below and complete the analysis on their own time. The workshop will start with a Hackathon session. Participants will from different organisations will form Hackathon teams will discuss and come up with innovative analysis ideas for a spatial transcriptomics dataset. At the second part, flash presentations (5 minutes) will be assessed by an expert panels and there will be prizes for the winning teams. 

**Possible entries to the challenge include:**

Technological innovation including better quality control, normalization pipeline, frameworks for comparison of pipelines,
Biological discovery or confirmation,
Analytical innovation including integration with other data sets, high-level visualisation and others.

Please note that entries are not limited to the above suggestions and participants are strongly encouraged to come up with new ways for utilizing these types of data.


# Challenge Entrants

Teams can consist of any number of people, but we encourage teams to have a mix of students, postdocs, and more senior academic staff. To register your team, please fill in our form here, note that this is not binding and you can change your mind later. One week before the single cell conference, we ask each team entering the challenge to provide us with a 200-word description of their entry.



# Judging criteria

A panel will judge the entries according to the novelty and potential impact on future single cell work. This could be in any of the following areas:

+ Computational techniques
+ Analysis methodology
+ Biological insight

In addition, the clarity and coherence of the presentation will be taken into account.


# Datasets

### Dataset 1 - computational challenge

##### SHORT SUMMARY
Dataset from the Swarbrick lab provides the participants with an opportunity to explore CITE-seq, a powerful new technology that allows simultaneous characterisation of both RNA and surface proteins. Hackers are invited to build stories around the biological (metastatic lymph node) or technical aspects (normalisation, visualisation, integration) of the data. 

##### BACKGROUND
Cell-surface proteins were historically crucial in describing cellular states, and were often a more reliable indicator of cellular activity and function than RNA expression. The Swarbrick Lab from Garvan Institute has implemented CITE-seq technology (Stoeckius et al. 2017) that couples protein and RNA information for individual cells, allowing a more powerful characterization of cellular phenotypes than transcriptome measurements alone. 

##### DATA
In the experiment below we applied multimodal analysis to phenotype immune cells in a human metastatic lymph node. After spiking in mouse cells (3T3) and staining with 96 CITE-seq antibodies (with IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b as isotype controls), the samples were analysed on Chromium 10x. All of the above are available in raw format or normalized and scaled Seurat objects (v3).

##### CHALLENGES
1.	Subset and visualize different cell populations using integrated RNA and CITE-seq data to determine differences between cellular populations
2.	Improve the default statistical framework for the QC of CITE antibodies using mouse spike-ins and IgG controls
3.	Compare CITE profiles with publicly available cell-type signatures (i.e. www.immgen.org)

##### FILES
1.	RAW CITE-seq COUNTS
+ Swarbrick_metastatic_lymphnode.CITE.csv
+ csv file 
2.	SEURAT OBJECT
+ Swarbrick_metastatic_lymphnode.seurat.Rdata
+ Seurat (v3) object with raw and processed data human and mouse data, with CITE-seq counts (RNA and ADT (antibody-derived tags)) included. 
+ data processed with Seurat_3.0.0.9100, normalized with SCTransform (stored in SCT assay) 
3.	ANTIBODY ANNOTATION
+ antibody_isotypes.csv

### Dataset 2 - Choices of benchmarking dataset


#### Dataset 2.1 - CellBench: single cell RNA-seq benchmarking



##### Description:

CellBench uses three human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines HCC827, H1975 and H2228, which were cultured separately, and then processed in three different ways. Firstly, single cells from each cell line were mixed in equal proportions, with libraries generated using three different protocols: CEL-seq2, Drop-seq (with Dolomite equipment) and 10X Chromium. Secondly, the single cells were sorted from the three cell lines into 384-well plates, with an equal number of cells per well in different combinations (generally 9-cells, but with some 90-cell population controls). Thirdly, RNA was extracted in bulk for each cell line and the RNA was mixed in 7 different proportions and diluted to single cell equivalent amounts ranging from 3.75pg to 30pg and processed using CEL-seq 2 and SORT-seq. ERCC spike-in controls were present in samples processed using the 2 plate-based technologies (CEL-seq2 and SORT-seq).

##### Download:

Raw data from this series of experiments is available under GEO accession number [GSE118767](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118767). The processed count data obtained from `scPipe` and stored in R objects that use the `SingleCellExperiment` class can be downloaded from https://github.com/LuyiTian/CellBench_data. The website contains instructions for getting the count data and metadata (including annotations) for each dataset. All data is post sample quality control, without gene filtering.

#### Dataset 2.2 - Ding et al. Benchmark Datasets

##### Description: 
 

A multitude of single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed in recent years, with dramatic advances in scale and power, and enabling major discoveries and large scale cell mapping efforts. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single cell and/or single nucleus profiling from three types of samples – cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue – generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To analyze these datasets, we developed and applied scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used for any scRNA-seq method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples. Our study will help guide experiments with the methods in this study as well as serve as a benchmark for future studies and for computational algorithm development.
